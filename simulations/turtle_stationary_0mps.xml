Stationary Turtle Mobility Script for Rescue Node
- Keeps the node at its configured initial position using minimal speed and wait commands.

  **.loRaRescueNodes[*].mobility.turtleScript = xmldoc("turtle_stationary_0mps.xml")
-->
<movement>
    <!-- Set minimal speed (TurtleMobility requires speed > 0) -->
    <set speed="0.001"/>

    <!-- Infinite loop: wait indefinitely to keep node stationary -->
    <repeat n="0">
        <wait t="1000000"/>
    </repeat>
</movement>
